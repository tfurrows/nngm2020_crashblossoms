# nngm2020 Crash Blossoms Novel

First, if you don't know what NaNoGenMo is, then you should go find out: [NaNoGenMo 2020](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2020)

Since I view writing as a pursuit, and programming as a hobby--and as NaNoWriMo isn't really my cup of tea--I thought I would give this a try for 2020.

## About the Project

I have a marginally interesting dataset which includes U.S. news headlines from top media outlets from the years 2017-2020. My problem has been, I have had no real use for the dataset. That is, until someone on [circumlunar.space](https://republic.circumlunar.space/) mentioned the 2020 NaNoGenMo.

The project is titled, _"Crash Blossoms, or History Above the Fold"_. It takes various segments of four years worth of news headlines, and programmatically turns them into novels. The title references are something you can DuckDuckGo, but they indicate that the resultant novel from this project is a sort of history made of bombastic headlines.

The code is written in the R language. I chose R for two reasons: It is supposed to be good with large sets of data; and, I had done very little with R, and was curious about it. I've been pleasantly surprised by R, the two times I've played with it, and I'm satisfied with the choice.

## The Results

Because the dataset is large (by my standards, not by Big Data standards), choices needed to be made in order to produce novels of reasonable lengths. Here is what I came up with:

* Crash Blossoms, or History Above the Fold, Volumes 1-4 (one for each year, 2017-2020)
* Trump Free Edition, Volumes 1-4 (one for each year, 2017-2020, exclude all headlines with the word "Trump")
* Crash Blossoms, or History Above the Fold, Coronavirus Edition (single volume for 2020, only headlines with "covid" or "coronavirus")
* Crash Blossoms, or History Above the Fold, The Abridged Version (single volume for 2017-2020)

The "Trump Free" edition is _not_ a political statement, but rather a practicality: there were an inordinate number of "Trump" headlines in the data, and it made sense to provide volumes that accounted for this excessive focus as an outlier.

## Download and Enjoy

I strongly recommend the .epub versions, which include the metadata. You will find some .txt versions that were not converted to .epub, if you're the very curious type.

Feel free to download and enjoy anything you find here. The code is very basic, and is public domain. The novels are Creative Commons, BY-NC-ND. I chose this licensing because I'm not entirely sure about the copy rights status of newspaper headlines; BY-NC-ND ensures that I remain responsible for my mess, and shows that I own up to it.

Another word on copyright: I consider this a work of parody and social commentary, and a work of digital art. Please know that I didn't see any sort of copyright notice that would apply to the headlines I gathered, and no one has complained of my use and collection of them over the years. If someone would like to complain, they could certainly locate the headline in question, inform me of the volume title and location in the text, and I would be more than happy to replace their headline with a redacted version.
